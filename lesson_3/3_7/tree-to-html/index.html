    <p>The boy's tale was passed down through generations until it became legend... But then, a day came when a fell wind began to blow across the kingdom... This boy, who traveled through time to save the land, was known as the Hero of Time... But then, when all hope had died and the hour of doom was at hand, a young boy in green appeared as if from nowhere... Are you him? Are you the one who was speaking through my stone without my permission? Answer me! </p>
